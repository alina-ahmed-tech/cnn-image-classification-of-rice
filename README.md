# Optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification of Rice Grains (AlexNet vs GoogleNet)

Rice grains have genetic variations, observable by differing features such as: texture, shape and colour. ​It is possible to classify different types of rice based on these features.​ The objective was to create an optimized CNN in MATLAB, building on publicly available pre-trained CNNs (AlexNet and GoogleNet) to to classify images of rice grains into 5 types: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala and Jasmine.
